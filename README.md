# BadAppleCeleste
This repository features the mod which displays the Bad Apple animation in celeste along with a helper application that converts a video into an rle file.
In order for the mod not to crash, you need to include an rle file generated by the VideoToRaw program in the celeste directory. The text file "badapple.rle" is a valid one to use.
I do not plan on modifying the contents of this mod further. I can not guarentee the successful execution of this mod on your computer. Feel free to fork this repo and modify as you see fit.

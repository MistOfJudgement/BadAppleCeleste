# BadAppleCeleste
This repository features the mod which displays the Bad Apple animation in celeste along with a helper application that converts a video into an rle file.
In order for the mod not to crash, you need to include an rle file generated by the VideoToRaw program in the celeste directory. The text file "badapple.rle" is a valid one to use.
I do not plan on modifying the contents of this mod further. I can not guarentee the successful execution of this mod on your computer. Feel free to fork this repo and modify as you see fit.

# How to Use
Either in the main menu or while the game is paused, the mod menu has two settings you can bind a key to. Speed boost will multiply your current velocity while the key is pressed. SpawnAnimationPixel will start playing Bad Apple and won't stop until you die or close the game. Because the display spawns at the world coords (0, 0), the display only shows up if you are in the first prologue screen or the first Forsaken City screen.
